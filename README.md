### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Profile

# I'm passionate about transforming ideas into powerful tech solutions! 

## ðŸš€ What Sets Me Apart

I put my data science knowledge to the test at BARC, India's premier research institute [BARC Website](https://www.barc.gov.in/#skip_to_main). I worked in the Radiopharmaceuticals division [Radiopharmaceuticals Division](https://www.barc.gov.in/group/72.html) under the supervision of B.G Avhad and Dr. Tapas Das. The main goal of my project was to automate the process of leak detection in heat exchangers and fault detection in distillation columns using data from radiotracers and gamma scans. 

I devised an algorithm in Python to detect leakages using peak detection techniques for heat exchangers and utilized Discrete Fourier Transform and Cross-correlation to compare the data of multiple gamma detectors, finding the degree of overlap. This was further developed into a user-friendly GUI-based software, increasing reliability, removing human error, and optimizing time and effort, translating into substantial economic savings. 

Two papers were published on this work, showcasing my commitment to impactful projects:
- [Paper 1](https://ijarsct.co.in/Paper4462.pdf)
- [Paper 2](https://ijarsct.co.in/A10088.pdf)

The following year, I worked on another fascinating data science project. BARC manufactures its own I-131 capsules, and the workers in these labs may be exposed to radioiodine. This time, the task was to develop a Radiation Monitoring Software System to detect dangerously high levels of radiation on individuals working with Radio-iodine (Iodine-131) in the Radiopharmaceuticals division. A thyroid monitoring system was designed and developed to ensure I-131 presence in the thyroid gland below the safe limit. The system features a collimated thyroid probe with a NaI(Tl) detector for gamma. The project replaces the conventional radiation counter with a more sophisticated hardware and software solution, implementing better features like automatic alarms when the count rate is above the safe limit, selective counting for radioiodine I-131, and displaying the energy spectrum, gross counts, and count rate.

Due to BARC's confidentiality policies, I was not allowed to publish the dataset, software, and code online.

## ðŸ”­ I'm Currently...

Taking a deeper dive into Neural Networks and Object-oriented design and development with Ruby on a larger scale, as apparent from my current projects on [Github](https://github.com/chinmay4613).

Let's build the future together! If you're as passionate about tech, data science, and Software Engineering as I am, let's connect and explore the possibilities.

## Hobbies 

I enjoy table tennis, skiing, ice skating, skateboarding, rock climbing, kayaking, and hiking.
